= Windows Spy - Display and resize windows on desktop

== What it does

WinSpy2 displays all the windows on the desktop in a hierarchical list, 
as well as the window class, size and position. The size and position 
can be updated. This tool was written for a localization project where 
screen captures of windows and other UI elements in the translated 
documentation had to have the same dimensions as the original English 
images. There are other, better tools out there including Spy++ which 
comes with Visual Studio; I would recommend using them instead. This 
really only serves as a historical curiosity on how to call Windows 
APIs from Visual Basic 6.

== User instructions

Double-click on a window title to see the window's child windows.

__Warning__: WinSpy2 shows all kinds of hidden windows it's probably 
_really_ not a good idea to muck about with. Use with caution.


== Build requisites

* Visual Basic 6
